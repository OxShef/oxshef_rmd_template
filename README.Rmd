# OxShef: RMarkdown Template Site

This is a template repository for adding content to the OxShef collaboration between University of Oxford and University of Sheffield. Please use this template if your site matches these criteria:

- The site will be written using RMarkdown files
- The site will make use of R output

The OxShef collaboration covers many different technologies and it might not be appropriate to use RMarkdown in all cases, in which case please do consider adding a new template repository so others can create similar subsites in the future.

Current websites in OxShef that use this template include:

- [OxShef Charts](https://oxshef.github.io/oxshef_charts/): A guide to different visualisation options for visualising research data

At the last full-build of the template the following R packages were required to build this package:

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
list.files(pattern = "Rmd", recursive = TRUE) %>%
  map(., ~readLines(.x, warn = FALSE)) %>%
  paste(collapse = "") %>%
  str_extract_all("library\\([^()]+\\)") %>%
  str_extract_all("\\([^()]+\\)") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  gsub("[^[:alnum:].]", "", .) %>%
  unique()
```


# Features of the site

This template borrows heavily from the design of the [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](rmarkdown.rstudio.com) website, in order to use it effectively you must be aware of the following:

1. Use the `_render-site.R` script to safely generate the website by knitting together all `.Rmd` files in the root directory of the project
1. Modify `_site.yml` to change the globaly used CSS and which elements from `includes/` are automatically included in all pages
1. `includes/` contains re-usable website elements as follows:
    + `includes/include_header.html` defines the horizontal navigation displayed at the top of each page
    + `includes/include_footer.html` defines the footer displayed at the bottom of each page
1. Add new pages by duplicating the example-page.Rmd file
