# OxShef: RMarkdown Template Site

This is a template repository for adding content to the OxShef collaboration between University of Oxford and University of Sheffield. Please use this template if your site matches these criteria:

- The site will be written using RMarkdown files
- The site will make use of R output

The OxShef collaboration covers many different technologies and it might not be appropriate to use RMarkdown in all cases, in which case please do consider adding a new template repository so others can create similar subsites in the future.

# Features of the site

This template borrows heavily from the design of [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and borrows
